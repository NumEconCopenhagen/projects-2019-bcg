# Modelproject

Our project does not have any special dependencies and no extra packages have to be installed locally except what is already provided in our notebook.

For our modelproject we decided to solve the OLG model. After introducing the general assumptions in markdown cell, we solve symbolically the Household's (i) and Firm's (ii) problems. More economics-related details are to also be found in our notebook. Mainly the household is trying to maximize utility through consumption while firms are trying to maximize profits, assuming perfect competition and no-adjustment cost. Moving to the step 3, we find both the symbolical and numerical solution for the aggregate level. Here, the crucial aggregation is that of physical capital. The symbolical solution is called the Key Transition Equation. Moving on (iv) we find the numerical solution for the aggregate level of our model. We plot the key transition equation to show how the capital converges towards the steady state over the time. The equilibrium steady state is the point where our key transition equation meets the 45 degrees line ( 𝑘𝑡+1=𝑘𝑡=𝑘∗ ). In our case, with the given values for parameters, k*= 0.03. The last step is the implementation of the Bisection method at the steady-state level. Using this method to calculate the capital per effective worker for steady state, we found that our model needs 18 iteration to reach the steady state and 𝑘∗  = 0.032844
