**Sbumission of BCG group**

Our portfolion consists of three main folders, the current README.MD file and a Feedback.txt file with a list of groups to which each of us gave peer feedback for the dataproject and modelproject. The three main folders are: dataproject, modelproject and examproject. All three folders consist of a README.md and a notebook (.ipynb) presenting the results of the specific project.

**Dataproject** 

Our Dataproject provides an overview of four main economic indicators for the 36 OECD countries during the time interval 2003-2017. The indicators we are looking at are: GDP growth (%), Inflation Rate (%), Total Unemployment (%) and Average Wage Growth (%). The data was directly imported from the Wolrd Bank website or downloaded as CSV files from the OECD website.

**Modelproject**

In our Modelproject we solde the OLG Model. Here, after solving the firm's and household's problems, we solve the model for the aggregate level of the economy where both the syombolical and the numerical solutions are provided. More preciseely, we look the aggregation of physical capital. Thee Key Transition Equation is plotted to show how the capital (per effective worker) evolves over time. Moreover, from that plot the steady state could be estimated approximately to k* = 0.03 (since it is the intersection of the Key Transition Equation and the 45 degree line).  After solving the Key Transition Equation wrt to k*, the Bisection method is implemented to find the numerical solution at which our model converges to the steady state and how many iterations are needed. The results show that our model needs 18 iteration to reach the steady state and the capital per effective worker (ùëò*) equals to 0.032844.

**Examproject**

The Examproject consists of three main questonis, are related to different economic models. First qustion is about maximizing utility of a worker living in two periods, with no savings or borrowing. he analyze the labour choice decision based on different levels of human capital. Problem 2 is about considering a AD-AS model settings and solving for equalibria and simulating them and illustrating the AR(1) process of the model for certain parameters. Problem 3 is looking at an exchange economy with three types of goods and a population of 500 consumers. First, we plot the budget shares of different goods for the consumers and then plot the demand function. In the end, we look at the Walras-equilibrium.
