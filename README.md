**Submission of BCG group**

The group consists of three members: btf484, lbj294 and gtb776. Our portfolio has three main folders, the current README.MD file and a Feedback.txt file with the groups at which each member provided peer feedback for the Dataproject and the Modelproject. The three main folders are: the Dataproject, the Modelproject and the Examproject. Each one consists of a README.md file with the description of each project, a notebook (.ipynb) presenting the results of the specific project and a fully documented python file (.py). 

**Dataproject** 

The Dataproject provides an overview of four main economic indicators for the 36 OECD countries during the time period from 2003 to 2017. The indicators we are looking at are: GDP Growth (%), Inflation Rate (%), Total Unemployment (%) and Average Wage Growth (%). The data were imported directly from the Wolrd's Bank website or downloaded as (.csv) files from the OECD website.

**Modelproject**

The Modelproject solves the Overlapping Generation (OLG) model. First we started by the symbolical implementation and solution of the firm's and household's problems. After calculating the equilibrium for the two previously mentioned problems, we proceed by solving the model for the aggregate level of the economy (both symbolically and numerically). From that part the Key Transition Equation was calculated, which presents the evolution of the capital (per effective worker) through time. Finally, the steady state of the OLG model was investigated, which was etimated numerically; for that purpose we used the Bisection method, to find the number of iterations (needed for our model to reach the steady state) and the numerical solution for capital per effective worker.

**Examproject**

The Examproject consists of three main questions related to different economic models. The first problem discusses the labour choice desicion, based on different levels of human capital, that a worker has to make, when she tries to maximize her utility under the assumptions of living for two periods and without the option of saving or borrowing. The second problem implements the AD-AS model, is solved at the equalibrium level and is simulated for different values for the parameters. Moreover, the third problem is looking at an exchange economy with three types of goods and a population of N consumers. First, the budget shares of each good is plotted and then the excess demand functions are calculated and plotted. In the end, we look at the Walras-equilibrium.
