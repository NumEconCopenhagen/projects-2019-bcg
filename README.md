** Sbumission of BCG group: names + exam number

Our portfolion consists of three main folders, the current README.MD file and a Feedback.txt file with a lost of groups to which each of us gave peer feedback for the dataproject and modelproject. The three main folders are called: dataproject, modelproject and examproject. All three folders consist of a README.md and a notebook (.ipynb) presenting the results of the specific project.

**Dataproject** 

Our Dataproject's provides an overview of four main economic indicators for the 36 OECD countries during the time interval 2003-2017. The indicators we are looking at are: GDP growth (%), Inflation Rate (%), Total Unemployment (%) and Average Wage Growth (%). The data was directly imported from the Wolrd Bank website or downloaded as CSV files from the OECD website.

* [README.md](/README.md): gives a short introduction to your project. You should change this file so it gives an introduction to what your repository consists of, and how to run the code to get your output. The present README file is always present on [github](https://www.github.com/numeconcopenhagen/numeconcopenhagen-2018/blob/master/README.md).
* [/binder](/binder/): The folder is used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of your repository. For details see this [guide](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/guides/mybinder/).
* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The structure is as follows: it contains a jupyter notebook where all the results should be presented. Furthermore, there is a python module named the dataproject where you can write and structure all your code.
* [/examproject](/examproject): Same structure as above.
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): Same structure as above.
* [.gitignore](/.gitignore): A textfile specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github, and will not be tracked by git.
