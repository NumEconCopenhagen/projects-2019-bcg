# Dataproject

Our project's purpose is to provide easy access to the main economics indicators for all the 36 countries that are OECD members, for the period 2003-2017. More precisly we gather together data on the following indicators: GDP growth (%), Inflation Rate (%), Total Unemployment (%) and Average Wage Growth (%).

First, we importend GDP Growth data directly from the World Bank website, while data for the other indicators were downloaded from OECD website as CSV files, locally, and then imported. After applying the neccesary cleaning and data structuring methods, and merging the different datasets together, the result was saved into the final dataset named "thedata". This dataframe is used for the next steps, where some summary statistics of our dataset are presented and three interactive plots in which different concepts could be investigated.
